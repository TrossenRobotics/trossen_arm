# Purpose:
# This script demonstrates how to do gravity compensation, which is useful for
# manually moving the arm to teach a trajectory or record specific positions.

# Hardware setup:
# 1. A WXAI V0 arm with leader end effector and ip at 192.168.1.2

# The script does the following:
# 1. Initializes the driver
# 2. Configures the driver
# 3. Sets the external efforts to 0s
# 4. Waits for the user to press enter
# 5. Sets the mode to idle
# 6. The driver automatically sets the mode to idle at the destructor

import trossen_arm

if __name__=='__main__':
    # Initialize the driver
    driver = trossen_arm.TrossenArmDriver()

    # Configure the driver
    driver.configure(
        trossen_arm.Model.wxai_v0,
        trossen_arm.StandardEndEffector.wxai_v0_leader,
        "192.168.1.2",
        False
    )

    # Start gravity compensation
    driver.set_all_modes(trossen_arm.Mode.external_effort)
    driver.set_all_external_efforts(
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        0.0,
        False
    )

    # Wait until the user presses enter
    input("Press Enter to end gravity compensation...")
