Trossen Arm Driver
------------------

* Added a new ``effort`` mode.
  It allows the user to command the effort of the joints without any built-in compensation like in the ``external_effort`` mode.
  This mode is useful for applications where full control of the joint efforts is desired.

Trossen Arm Controller Firmware
-------------------------------

* Added the associated interfaces for the new ``effort`` mode.
