Purpose:
This script demonstrates how to move two robots to different positions using interpolation.

Hardware setup:
1. A WXAI V0 arm with leader end effector and ip at 192.168.1.2
2. A WXAI V0 arm with follower end effector and ip at 192.168.1.3

The script does the following:
1. Initializes the drivers
2. Configures the drivers with the leader and follower configurations
3. Sets the robots to position mode
4. Records the sleep positions
5. Generates trajectories: sleep -> sleep -> home -> home -> sleep -> sleep
6. Moves the robots along the trajectories
7. Sets the robots to the idle mode
8. The driver automatically sets the mode to idle at the destructor
