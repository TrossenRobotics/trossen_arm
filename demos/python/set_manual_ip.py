# Purpose:
# This script demonstrates how to set the manual IP address in the EEPROM.

# Hardware setup:
# 1. A WXAI V0 arm with leader end effector and ip at 192.168.1.2

# The script does the following:
# 1. Initializes the driver
# 2. Configures the driver
# 3. Gets and sets the manual IP address
# 4. Reboots the controller to apply the new IP address
# 5. Reconfigures the driver and checks the result

import trossen_arm

if __name__=='__main__':
    # Initialize the driver
    driver = trossen_arm.TrossenArmDriver()

    # Configure the driver
    driver.configure(
        trossen_arm.Model.wxai_v0,
        trossen_arm.StandardEndEffector.wxai_v0_leader,
        "192.168.1.2",
        False
    )

    # Print the current IP address
    print("Current IP address: ", driver.get_manual_ip())

    # Set the IP address of the robot to 192.168.1.3
    driver.set_manual_ip("192.168.1.3")

    # Print the new IP address
    print("New IP address: ", driver.get_manual_ip())

    # Reboot the controller to apply the new IP address
    driver.cleanup(True)  # or driver.reboot_controller()

    # Reconfigure the driver
    driver.configure(
        trossen_arm.Model.wxai_v0,
        trossen_arm.StandardEndEffector.wxai_v0_leader,
        "192.168.1.3",
        False
    )

    # Print the IP address after reboot
    print("IP address after reboot: ", driver.get_manual_ip())
