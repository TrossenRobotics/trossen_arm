Purpose:
This script demonstrates how to set the manual IP address in the EEPROM.

Hardware setup:
1. A WXAI V0 arm with leader end effector and ip at 192.168.1.2

The script does the following:
1. Initializes the driver
2. Configures the driver with the follower configuration
3. Sets the IP address of the robot
4. The driver cleans up automatically at the destructor
5. Power cycle to apply the new IP address
'''

import trossen_arm

if __name__=='__main__':
    # Initialize the driver
    driver = trossen_arm.TrossenArmDriver()

    # Configure the driver
    driver.configure(
        trossen_arm.Model.wxai_v0,
        trossen_arm.StandardEndEffector.wxai_v0_leader,
        "192.168.1.2",
        False
    )

    # Print the current IP address
    print("Current IP address: ", driver.get_manual_ip())

    # Set the IP address of the robot to 192.168.1.3
    driver.set_manual_ip("192.168.1.3")

    # Print the new IP address
    print("New IP address: ", driver.get_manual_ip())

    # Power cycle to apply the new IP address
    print("Power cycle the robot to apply the new IP address.")
