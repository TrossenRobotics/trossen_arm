Trossen AI Configuration
========================

In order to use the Trossen AI Kits with LeRobot, you need to first configure the arms with the necessary specifications.
The specifications include the IP address, model_name, and camera serial numbers.
The following steps will guide you on how to configure the Trossen AI Kits with LeRobot.

This is an example of a configuration file for the Trossen AI Kits with LeRobot, you can find this in :guilabel:`lerobot/common/robot_devices/robots/configs.py`:

Setup IP Address
----------------

.. note::

    By default, the IP address for a Trossen AI arm is set to ``192.168.1.2``. 
    Make sure to change the IP addresses of your Trossen AI arms to match the ones in the configuration file.
    
To set up the IP address for the Trossen AI Arms, you must first ensure that the arms are connected to the same network as your computer.
Refer to :ref:`Ethernet Setup <getting_started/software_setup:Ethernet Setup>` for correct connection instructions.
Once connected, you can find or configure the IP address using the :ref:`getting_started/demo_scripts:`configure_cleanup`_` demo or the :ref:`getting_started/demo_scripts:`set_ip_method`_` and :ref:`getting_started/demo_scripts:`set_manual_ip`_` demos.

Camera Serial Number
--------------------

There are two ways to set up the camera serial numbers for the Trossen AI Kits with LeRobot: using the Intel RealSense interface or the OpenCV interface.
Based on the camera interface you choose, follow the appropriate steps below to set up the camera serial numbers.
You can setup both interfaces at the same time, and use the ``--robot.camera_interface`` argument to switch between them.
By default, the camera interface is set to ``intel_realsense``.
We will look at this in more detail in the next sections.

    .. group-tab:: Intel RealSense Interface

        #.  Open realsense-viewer

            .. code-block:: bash

                realsense-viewer

            .. note::

                If realsense-viewer is not already installed on your machine, follow `these steps on the librealsense GitHub repository <https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/doc/distribution_linux.md>`_  to install ``librealsense2-utils``.

        #.  Plug in a single camera and check the sidebar for its entry.
            If it does not show up in the side bar, click Add Source and find the Intel RealSense D405 in the drop down.

        #.  Click on Info for the camera, find the Serial Number, and copy it.

        #.  Put the camera serial number in the appropriate config entry at :guilabel:`lerobot/common/robot_devices/robots/configs.py`.

        #.  Repeat for the rest of the cameras.

    .. group-tab:: OpenCV Interface

        The `OpenCVCamera <https://github.com/Interbotix/lerobot/blob/trossen-ai/lerobot/common/robot_devices/cameras/opencv.py>`_ class allows you to efficiently record frames from most cameras using the `opencv2 <https://docs.opencv.org>`_ library. 
        For more details on compatibility, see `Video I/O with OpenCV Overview <https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d0/da7/videoio_overview.html>`_.

        To instantiate an `OpenCVCamera <https://github.com/Interbotix/lerobot/blob/trossen-ai/lerobot/common/robot_devices/cameras/opencv.py>`_, you need a camera index (e.g. :guilabel:`OpenCVCamera(camera_index=0)`).
        When you only have one camera like a webcam of a laptop, the camera index is usually ``0`` but it might differ, and the camera index might change if you reboot your computer or re-plug your camera.
        This behavior depends on your operating system.


        #.  To find the camera indices, run the following utility script, which will save a few frames from each detected camera:

            .. code-block:: bash

                python lerobot/common/robot_devices/cameras/opencv.py \
                --images-dir outputs/images_from_opencv_cameras

            The output will look something like this if you have two cameras connected:

            .. code-block:: bash

                Mac or Windows detected. Finding available camera indices through scanning all indices from 0 to 60

        #. Check the saved images in :guilabel:`outputs/images_from_opencv_cameras` to identify which camera index corresponds to which physical camera (e.g. ``0`` for ``camera_00`` or ``1`` for ``camera_01``):

            .. note::
                
                Some cameras may take a few seconds to warm up, and the first frame might be black or green.

        #. Put the camera index in the appropriate config entry at :guilabel:`lerobot/common/robot_devices/robots/configs.py`.
