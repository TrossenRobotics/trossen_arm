# Purpose:
# This script demonstrates how to reset the EEPROM to defaults.

# Hardware setup:
# 1. A WXAI V0 arm with leader end effector and ip at 192.168.1.2

# The script does the following:
# 1. Initializes the driver
# 2. Configures the driver
# 3. Gets and sets the factory reset flag
# 4. Reboots the controller to apply the default EEPROM settings
# 5. Reconfigures the driver and checks the result

import trossen_arm

if __name__=='__main__':
    # Initialize the driver
    driver = trossen_arm.TrossenArmDriver()

    # Configure the driver
    driver.configure(
        trossen_arm.Model.wxai_v0,
        trossen_arm.StandardEndEffector.wxai_v0_leader,
        "192.168.1.2",
        False
    )

    # Print the current factory reset flag
    print("Current factory reset flag: ", driver.get_factory_reset_flag())

    # Reset the EEPROM to defaults
    driver.set_factory_reset_flag(True)

    # Print the factory reset flag
    print("Factory reset flag set to: ", driver.get_factory_reset_flag())

    # Reboot the controller to apply the default EEPROM settings
    driver.cleanup(True)  # or driver.reboot_controller()

    # Reconfigure the driver
    driver.configure(
        trossen_arm.Model.wxai_v0,
        trossen_arm.StandardEndEffector.wxai_v0_leader,
        "192.168.1.2",
        False
    )

    # Print the factory reset flag after reboot
    print("Factory reset flag after reboot: ", driver.get_factory_reset_flag())
