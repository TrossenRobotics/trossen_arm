# Purpose:
# This script demonstrates how to open and close the gripper.

# Hardware setup:
# 1. A WXAI V0 arm with leader end effector and ip at 192.168.1.2

# The script does the following:
# 1. Initializes the drivers
# 2. Configures the drivers
# 3. Opens the gripper
# 4. Closes the gripper
# 5. The driver automatically sets the mode to idle at the destructor
