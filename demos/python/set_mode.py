# Purpose:
# This script demonstrates how to set the mode of the robot.

# Hardware setup:
# 1. A WXAI V0 arm with leader end effector and ip at 192.168.1.2

# The script does the following:
# 1. Initializes the driver
# 2. Configures the driver with the leader configuration
# 3. Sets the gripper mode to "position"
# 4. Sets the arm mode to "position"
# 5. Sets the all mode to "idle"
# 6. The driver cleans up automatically at the destructor

import trossen_arm

if __name__=='__main__':
    # Initialize the driver
    driver = trossen_arm.TrossenArmDriver()

    # Configure the driver
    driver.configure(
        trossen_arm.Model.wxai_v0,
        trossen_arm.StandardEndEffector.wxai_v0_leader,
        "192.168.1.2",
        False
    )

    # Set the modes of the gripper joints to "position"
    driver.set_gripper_mode(trossen_arm.Mode.position)

    # Print the modes of the gripper joints
    print("Modes: ", driver.get_modes())

    # Press Enter to continue
    input("Press Enter to continue...")

    # Set the modes of the arm joints to "position"
    driver.set_arm_modes(trossen_arm.Mode.position)

    # Print the modes of the arm joints
    print("Modes: ", driver.get_modes())

    # Press Enter to continue
    input("Press Enter to continue...")

    # Set the modes of the all joints to "idle"
    driver.set_all_modes(trossen_arm.Mode.idle)

    # Print the modes of the all joints
    print("Modes: ", driver.get_modes())

    # Press Enter to continue
