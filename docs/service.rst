If a motor is replaced or if the arm loses its position for any reason, it is necessary to home the arm.
The process for homing the arm is as follows:

#.  Power off the arm.
#.  Remove the gripper fingers or paddles from the gripper carriages.
#.  Install the homing jigs on the base and wrist rotate motors.
