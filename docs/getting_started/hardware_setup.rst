Hardware Setup
==============

This section walks you through the hardware setup for a new Trossen Arm.

What You Need
=============

To get started, you will need the following:

-   Trossen Arm
-   Trossen Arm Controller
-   24V Power Supply
-   Linux PC
-   Ethernet Switch (Optional)

Mounting the Arm
================

The Trossen Arm comes pre-assembled, so you will only need to mount it to a sturdy surface.
The dimensions of the mounting holes at the base are shown below.

.. note::

    If only one arm is being used, the Arm Controller can connect directly to the PC via the provided Ethernet cable.
    In this case, the Ethernet switch is not needed.

.. warning::

    Make sure the Arm Controller is OFF before connecting any cables to it.

.. warning::

    Please connect to the switch only the devices required by your application.
    Low-quality connections can cause the arm to behave unexpectedly.
